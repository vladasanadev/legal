  <h1>Privacy Policy – My App</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 31 October 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our service (“Service”).</p>

  <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account info from TikTok that you authorize (e.g. user ID, basic profile).</li>
    <li>Tokens/credentials needed to upload or post videos on your behalf.</li>
    <li>Basic usage data (for debugging and security).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use it</h2>
  <p>We use this data only to provide the Service — e.g. to let you schedule or post content to TikTok from your app.</p>

  <h2>3. Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with service providers we use to run the Service (hosting, logging) and when required by law.</p>

  <h2>4. Storage & security</h2>
  <p>We store data for as long as needed to provide the Service. We use reasonable security measures, but no method is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-party services (TikTok)</h2>
  <p>Your use of TikTok is also governed by TikTok’s own terms and policies. We do not control TikTok’s handling of your data.</p>

  <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
  <p>You can revoke our access to your TikTok account at any time in TikTok’s settings or by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>Email: your-email@example.com</p>
